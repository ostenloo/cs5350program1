Programming Assignment 1

For the programs, do not use any built-in libraries for the linked list. You must have the liked list create, insert, etc. source code in your program.  You may use referenced source code from the internet.  You may use the built-in uniform random number generator and assume it operates in Θ(1).  For each problem:
Run your code for various values of n and time it, 
Create a table showing the running times for various values of “n”, 
Create a graph of the running times vs various values of “n”. Use a linear scale on the axes.

[50 pts] Write a program that takes a value “n” as input and prints “Hello, World” n times.
	
[50 pts] Write a program that takes a value “n” as input; produces “n” random numbers with a uniform distribution between 1 and n and places them in a linked list in sorted order.  Place each one individually in the linked list where they belong to be in order, do not sort the list after placing them there.
